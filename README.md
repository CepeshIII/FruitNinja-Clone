# 🍉 Fruit Ninja Clone – Unity Project

This is a Fruit Ninja-style slicing game I created as part of the "Master C# Programming from A to Z" course — specifically in the Unity development section.
# 📚 About the Course

This project was developed while studying:

    C# fundamentals and advanced features

    OOP and Clean Code

    Event-driven architecture

    Game development with Unity

    Real-time interaction using Unity's input systems

# 🎮 Game Overview

In this Fruit Ninja clone, the player slices flying low-poly fruits while avoiding low-poly bombs. The game is fast, satisfying, and supports multi-touch gameplay (up to 10 touches simultaneously), making it ideal for mobile and touchscreen devices.
# 🧰 Tools & Tech Used

    Unity 6.0 (6000.0.25f1)

    Universal Render Pipeline (URP) for stylized visuals

    New Input System with multi-touch support

    C# scripting

    Unity's physics and particle systems

    Object pooling for fruit and bomb spawning

    Clean UI with score and combo tracking

# 🛠️ Key Features

    🍌 Low-poly fruits that fly into view and can be sliced

    💣 Low-poly bombs that end the game if touched

    🖐️ Up to 10 simultaneous touches supported

    ⚔️ Slice effect animations and particles

    🎯 Score system with combos

    🎮 Fully responsive on touchscreen and mouse

    🔁 Continuous wave-based spawning system

# 💡 What I Learned

    Implementing touch-based interaction with Unity's New Input System

    Managing multiple inputs simultaneously

    Using object pooling for performance

    Working with physics-based slicing mechanics

    Game state management and score tracking

    Polishing user feedback with visuals and sound

# 🚀 How to Run

    Clone or download this repository.

    Open the project in Unity 6.0 (6000.0.25f1) or newer.

    Make sure URP and New Input System are installed and active.

    Enable touch simulation by toggling "Simulate Touch Input From Mouse or Pen" on in the "Options" dropdown of the Input Debugger(for works with mouse input).
    
    Click Play in the Unity Editor
